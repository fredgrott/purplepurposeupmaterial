      <!-- NAV NOTES: Materialize CSS Framework deefines the navbar and its
           variations as row elements, ie most of the time for a complex
           heeader navigation one will use multiple nav star-end tag pairs
           such as I have shown here.

           Href Link Coloring has been modified to present a consistent look and
           feel of a complex nvaigation composed of a regualr navbar, dropdowns,
           and icons.

           BREADCRUMB NOTES: breadcrubs is included in the pagetemplates and
           pages as a main content item wrapper in nav tags as that way it
           still displays within the mobile environment.

                  browser prefixes. It's not pretty but it does work.

                  Instead of using a label here, we adjust the position of an i-con
                  tag with its UI element to rest inside the input box. Which is a much
                  cleaner look than an icon prefix to the input field.
